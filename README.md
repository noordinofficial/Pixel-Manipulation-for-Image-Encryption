# Task 2: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## Overview
This project demonstrates image encryption using pixel manipulation techniques in Python. Pixel values are modified to encrypt the image, and the process can be reversed to decrypt it.

## Features
- Encrypts an image by altering pixel values.
- Decrypts an image to its original form.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

## How to Use
1. Provide the input image file path.
2. Run the script with the desired encryption key.
3. The encrypted image will be saved.
4. Decrypt the image by running the script again with the same key.

## Example
- Input Image: `img.png`
- Encrypted Image: `encrypted_img.png`
- Decrypted Image: `decrypted_img.png`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)
